Project Name: ADC Readout Using I2C Protocol Driver (for HCMS HGCAL to read out voltages on Hexaboard)
Creator: Margot Lockwood
Advisor: Andre David

Fall 2022

The goal of this project is to create a program that makes ADC readout out using I2C protocol easy (and fun!). This readout should be useful in order to probe voltages on the hexaboard, a way to check if the board is working. 

This code works with an ADS112C04 16-Bit Chip with an I^2C Interface. 

This program *will* have a configure file (in YAMLE) where you can set *things*.
